# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement a variety of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are used for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection without the need for labeled data. The repository covers the following popular algorithms:

## Description
Unsupervised learning techniques are used to uncover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures from input data. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained with labeled data, unsupervised learning focuses on unlabeled data to find hidden insights.

## Each algorithm in this repository serves different purposes:

Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) group data points based on similarity.
Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (e.g., PCA, Autoencoders) reduce the number of features in the data while preserving its essence.
Density-Based Clustering (e.g., DBSCAN, Mean-Shift) groups data based on the density of data points, particularly useful for discovering clusters of varying shapes.
## Key Algorithms and Their Applications:
### K-Means Clustering

A simple, fast, and widely used clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on the distance to centroids.
Commonly used in customer segmentation, market basket analysis, and image compression.
### Hierarchical Clustering

Builds a tree of clusters using either a bottom-up or top-down approach.
Useful for hierarchical representations of data, like gene trees in biology.
### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

Groups together data points that are closely packed, marking outliers as noise.
Effective for discovering clusters of varying shapes and identifying noise in datasets.
### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

A probabilistic model assuming that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.
Widely used for data with overlapping clusters or soft clustering tasks.
### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto new axes with the maximum variance.
Used in reducing feature spaces, visualizing high-dimensional data, and speeding up machine learning models.
### Autoencoders

A type of neural network used for dimensionality reduction or anomaly detection.
Commonly used in image reconstruction, denoising, and generative models.
### Agglomerative Clustering

A hierarchical clustering method that builds clusters iteratively by merging smaller clusters.
Suitable for creating cluster hierarchies or nested groupings.
### Mean-Shift Clustering

A non-parametric clustering method that seeks the mode of the distribution.
Used for finding clusters without defining the number of clusters in advance.
## Conclusion
Unsupervised learning algorithms play a crucial role in exploring and understanding data when labels are unavailable. This repository provides implementations of various unsupervised algorithms, demonstrating their effectiveness in different scenarios. Each algorithm has its strengths and is suitable for different types of data and use cases, whether itâ€™s for clustering, anomaly detection, or reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data.
